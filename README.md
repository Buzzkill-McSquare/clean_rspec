# Clean RSpec
**A workshop on Ruby Testing Craftsmanship**

Testing has been a feature of the Ruby community for a long time. Why then are our spec files often so incomprehensible? In this workshop, I will share some ground rules for writing maintainable tests that will ensure that new teammates along with future-you can understand your test suite. We will use the RSpec testing framework to introduce several testing code-smells. For each smell, I will provide a demonstration on how to refactor the test along with time to practice for workshop participants. This workshop is geared towards anyone looking to hone their Ruby testing craft.
