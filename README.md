# Clean RSpec
**A workshop on Ruby Testing Craftsmanship**

Testing has been a feature of the Ruby community for a long time. Why then are our spec files often so incomprehensible? In this workshop, I will share some ground rules for writing maintainable tests that will ensure that new teammates along with future-you can understand your test suite. We will use the RSpec testing framework to introduce several testing code-smells. For each smell, I will provide a demonstration on how to refactor the test along with time to practice for workshop participants. This workshop is geared towards anyone looking to hone their Ruby testing craft.

# Getting Started

Clone this repository, change directories to the project's root, and bundle install.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/jesse-spevack/clean_rspec.git
> cd clean_rspec
> bundle install
```

# Running Tests

Run tests with the `rspec` command. See [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec)

```bash
> rspec
```

# References

This workshop is based off of the [Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose).

We are using a [Ruby translation](https://github.com/clayhill/Gilded-Rose-Refactoring-Kata) following the style from the amazing [Sandi Metz](https://sandimetz.com/) 2014 Railsconf talk, [All the Little Things](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE).

# Workshop

The name for this workshop is a reference to [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) by [Robert C. Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin), which describes the techniques and practices of writing code that is easy to read and change.

The goal of this workshop is to take some of the principles from *Clean Code* and apply them to writing tests with RSpec.
## Learning Outcomes
Participants will hone their understanding of writing clean tests by refactoring an example RSpec file. Through this exercise participants will be able to:

- Describe the purpose and benefits of testing
- Understand the concept of *system under test*
- Write tests that document code functionality
- Implement the *three-phase test pattern*
- Optimize for readability
- Use test doubles judiciously

## System Under Test

The subject keyword can be used to identify the system under test

```ruby
class GildedRose
  # ...
end

# Bad
describe GildedRose do
  it 'is instantiated by RSpec' do
    expect(subject).to be_a GildedRose
  end
end

# Less Bad
describe GildedRose do
  subject { GildedRose.new }

  it 'is instantiated by RSpec' do
    expect(subject).to be_a GildedRose
  end
end

# Good
describe GildedRose do
  subject(:gilded_rose) { GildedRose.new }

  it 'is instantiated by RSpec' do
    expect(gilded_rose).to be_a GildedRose
  end
end
```
